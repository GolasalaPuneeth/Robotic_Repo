Servo synchronization using audio signals and mapping technique
This repository contains code for servo synchronization using audio signals and a mapping technique. The code uses pulse width modulation (PWM) to generate the audio signals.

How it works:

The code works by first generating a set of audio signals. The audio signals are generated using PWM. The frequency and duty cycle of the PWM signals are varied to create different tones.

The code then uses a mapping technique to map the audio signals to the servo positions. The mapping technique is used to ensure that the servos are synchronized with the audio signals.

Example usage:

To use the code, simply connect the servo motors to the microcontroller. Then, upload the code to the microcontroller.

Once the code is uploaded, you can start the servo synchronization by sending an audio signal to the microcontroller. The servos will then move to the positions that are mapped to the audio signal.

Benefits:

This method of servo synchronization has several benefits:

It is very accurate.
It is very fast.
It is very reliable.
Applications:

This method of servo synchronization can be used in a variety of applications, such as:

Robotics
Animation
Special effects
Industrial automation
Conclusion:

This code provides a simple and effective way to synchronize servo motors using audio signals and a mapping technique. The code is well-written and easy to understand.
